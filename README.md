# IntroductionThe [eos-forum software](https://github.com/Novusphere/eos-forum) hosted at https://eos-forum.org allows users to elect delegated moderators to help manage content. Moderators are able to pin threads, mark threads as spam/nsfw,  and mark accounts. Anyone can be a moderator.To add yourself to the known moderator list, please submit a pull request editing the `list.json` file in this repository.# Setting up your own proxy forumPlease see the [eos-forum-proxy](https://github.com/Novusphere/eos-forum-proxy) repository for details.# About ModeratingModeration uses json files on a monthly basis (time in UTC). Please refer to the [example.json](https://github.com/Novusphere/eos-forum-mod/blob/master/example.json) file for all available fields/settings and the [eos-forum-mod](https://github.com/Novusphere/eos-forum-mod) repository for file naming structure. Please also always run your updated moderator files through a [json validator](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/) before committing to GitHub!When moderating content always use the **original** transaction id. If a post has been edited, to get the original post's transaction id -- click "history" and click "on chain" for the top most post.
